Title: Fitting dynamic frailty models with the EM algorithm
Version: 0.3.1
Author: Theodor Adrian Balan
Maintainer: Theodor Adrian Balan <t.a.balan@lumc.nl>
Description: Fits semiparametric dynamic frailty models according to the methodology of Putter and van Houwelingen (2016). Intermediate models, where the frailty is piecewise constant on pre-specified intervals, are also supported. The frailty process is taken to have a specific auto-correlation structure, and the supported distributions include gamma, inverse Gaussian, PVF and positive stable.
