## Package info

This is an R package for fitting semiparametric dynamic frailty models with the EM algorithm. The hazard for individual $j$ from cluster $i$ is specified as:
$$
\lambda_{ij}(t | Z_i(t)) = Z_i(t) \exp(\beta^\top x_{ij}(t)) \lambda_0(t).
$$
The model used here is described in detail in [Putter & van Houwelingen (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxv002). The distribution of $Z_i(t)$ is described by two parameters: $\theta$, that is an inverse-variability parameter of $Z_i(t)$ for a fixed $t$, and $\lambda$, that describes the autocorrelation of the process, so that for $t_1 \leq t_2$
$$
\mathrm{cor}(Z_i(t_1), Z_i(t_2)) = \exp(\lambda (t_2 - t_1)).
$$

The estimation process is that for fixed $(\theta, \lambda)$ the maximized profile likelihood is calculated, i.e. maximized with respect to $(\beta, \lambda_0)$. This profile likelihood is finally maximized itself. 

## Installation
The development version from `GitHub`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tbalan/dynfrail")
```
The following packages are needed to build `dynfrail`:
```{r, eval = FALSE} 
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo", "tibble", "magrittr", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
```
The functioning of the package is described in the documentation of the main fitting function, `dynfrail()`. 

## Features

- gamma, PVF, compount Poisson, inverse Gaussian distributions
- flexible adjustment of estimation parameters
- semiparametric $Z(t)$ that changes values at every $t$ or piecewise constant $Z(t)$
- clustered survival data & recurrent events (calendar time or gaptime) ar supported

## Functions

- `dynfrail()` has a friendly syntax very similar to the `frailtyEM` package: next to a `formula` and `data` argument, the `distribution` argument is used to specify the distribution parameters and the `control` parameter is used for controling the precision of the estimation.
- `dynfrail_prep()` and `dynfrail_fit()` are used internally by `dynfrail()` but are made user-available. The first one prepares the input of `dynfrail()` to make it suitable for the actual EM algorithm. The second one performs one EM algorithm for fixed $(\theta, \lambda)$ to estimate the maximum ($\beta$, $\lambda_0$). 

## Limitations

- slow even for medium sized data sets. It is recommended to start with a small number of piecewise constant intervals and/or a subset of the data
- no direct standard errors for $(\theta, \lambda)$.

## Analyzing the output
We take the `asthma` data set in the `parfm` package. I take a subset where each individual is censored after 3 events.
```{r}
library(parfm)
library(dplyr)
data(asthma)

small_asthma <- 
  asthma %>% 
  group_by(Patid) %>% 
  mutate(linenr = 1:n()) %>% 
  filter(linenr <= 3)
```

This is a recurrent events data set in Andersen-Gill format with one covariate (`Drug`).
```{r}
head(small_asthma)
```

This is a fit with a gamma piecewise constant frailty with 2 intervals:
```{r}
library(dynfrail)
m2 <- dynfrail(Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), data = small_asthma,
         distribution = dynfrail_dist(n_ints = 1))
m2
```

From the output we see that the estimated frailty variance is around 0.48, and the estimated auto correlation between 10 days is
$\exp(-0.628 \times 10) \approx 0.002$. 

An inverse Gaussian fit with 3 intervals for the frailty would works like this:
```{r}
m3_ig <- dynfrail(Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), data = small_asthma,
         distribution = dynfrail_dist(dist = "pvf", n_ints = 2))
m3_ig
```
The interpretation goes similar with that from the previous model. 

The baseline hazard can be plotted like this:
```{r}
with(m3_ig, plot(tev, cumsum(hazard), main = "Baseline cumulative hazard", ylab = "H0", xlab = "time"))
```

The empirical Bayes frailty estimates are stored in here: 
```{r}
m3_ig$frail_id %>% 
  select(id, tstart, tstop, frail) %>% 
  head()
```


Let's plot the frailty estimates of individual 1:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
m3_ig$frail_id %>% 
  filter(id == 1) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_segment(aes(x = tstart, xend = tstop, y = frail, yend = frail)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 3)) + 
  theme_classic()

```

For the 3 indiviudals the estimated frailty looks like:
```{r}
m3_ig$frail_id %>% 
  filter(id <= 3) %>% 
  mutate(id = as.factor(id)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_segment(aes(x = tstart, xend = tstop, y = frail, yend = frail, colour = id)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 3)) + 
  theme_classic()
```

Now for 5 piecewise-constant intervals, again inverse Gaussian frailty. This takes a while if you try to run it:
```{r}
m5_ig <- dynfrail(Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), data = small_asthma,
         distribution = dynfrail_dist(dist = "pvf", n_ints = 4))
m5_ig
```

Now the first 3 individuals look like this:
```{r}
m5_ig$frail_id %>% 
  filter(id <= 3) %>% 
  mutate(id = as.factor(id)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_segment(aes(x = tstart, xend = tstop, y = frail, yend = frail, colour = id)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 3)) + 
  theme_classic()
```

Look at the log-likelihoods:
```{r}
c(m3_ig$loglik[2], m5_ig$loglik[2])
```
Seems that the model with 5 piecewise constant intervals has a higher log-likelihood than the one with 3 piecewise constant intervals.

### Calculating the likelihood at specific frailty distributions
We saw where the maximum likelihood in model `m5` lies:
```{r}
m5_ig
```
Say we want the likelihood for $\theta = 3$ (variance of the frailty 0.33). This can be done in two steps:
```{r}
args_5 <- dynfrail_prep(formula = Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), 
    data = small_asthma, distribution = dynfrail_dist(dist = "pvf", 
        n_ints = 4))

lik_5 <- do.call(dynfrail_fit, c(logfrailtypar = list(c(log(3), m5_ig$loglambda)), args_5))
lik_5
```
Of course that the likelihood is smaller than the maximum likelihood. 
This is useful though; for example, in this way it can be seen how the likelihood varies in $\lambda$. Furthermore, `dynfrail_fit` may be plugges into any maximizer in this way. 

### 1 piecewise-constant interval
Then the result is the same as the regular shared frailty model:
```{r}
m1 <- dynfrail(Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), data = small_asthma,
         distribution = dynfrail_dist(n_ints = 0))
m1
```

Compare with the (gamma) shared frailty model:
```{r}
library(frailtyEM)
m1_sf <- emfrail(Surv(Begin, End, Status) ~ Drug + cluster(Patid), data = small_asthma)
summary(m1_sf)
```

Note that in this case the likelihood is completely flat in $\lambda$! This can be checked as was shown in the previous part.
